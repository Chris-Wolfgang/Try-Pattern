## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-01

Canonical maintenance round + binding-stability fix. No public API or
runtime behavior change vs v0.3.1.

### Added

- **D8** — `verify-docs-build` job in `release.yaml` runs DocFX during
  the release pipeline before the NuGet push, so a docs build failure
  now blocks the package from shipping.
- **D8** — docs site version picker assets
  (`docfx_project/public/version-picker.js`,
  `docfx_project/versions.json`) and `docs/DOCFX-VERSION-PICKER.md`.
- **A1** — `PublicApiAnalyzers` scaffolding (analyzers activate when
  `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` / `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` are present
  alongside the csproj).
- **CI3** — canonical NuGet package metadata: `Authors`, `Copyright`,
  `RepositoryType`, SourceLink, snupkg symbol packages, deterministic
  CI build flag, and `EmbedUntrackedSources` hoisted to
  `Directory.Build.props`.
- **T3** — Stryker mutation-testing workflow (`stryker.yaml`).
- **T1** — coverage report published to docs site.
- **S1** — CodeQL `security-extended` query pack.
- **D6** — versions.json preservation guard on the docs deploy.

### Changed

- **C1** — fleet-wide template-drift sync: workflow files (`pr.yaml`,
  `release.yaml`, `docfx.yaml`, `codeql.yaml`,
  `build-all-versions.yaml`, `stryker.yaml`), `.editorconfig`,
  `BannedSymbols.txt`, `Directory.Build.props`, and per-context
  `tests/Directory.Build.props` consolidated to the canonical baseline.
- **Nullable** — `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` consolidated into
  `Directory.Build.props` (was per-csproj); per-project opt-out via
  override still supported.
- **CI2** — Dependabot `github-actions` ecosystem added.
- **D3** — repo scripts hardened (`Setup-Labels.ps1`,
  `Fix-BranchRuleset.ps1`).
- `github/codeql-action/init` and `analyze` bumped v3 → v4
  (Node.js 20 → 24 deprecation).

### Fixed

- **C4** — restored explicit `<AssemblyVersion>1.0.0.0</AssemblyVersion>`
  and added a prerelease-safe `<FileVersion>` (regex-strip property
  function) to the src csproj. The original C4 fanout had dropped
  these on the rationale that the hardcoded values were "stale"
  relative to released package versions — but that staleness was the
  correct binding-stability behaviour for libraries that ship a
  `net462` TFM. Without an explicit pin, SDK-derived `AssemblyVersion`
  would change on every minor/patch release, breaking .NET Framework
  consumers without a binding redirect. (See DateTime-Extensions v1.3.1
  for the post-mortem on what happens when this regression reaches a
  release.)
